  login >> set target >> input workout >> exceed target >> receive alert

- For the Visual
  this week’s activity page with one button “Log Workout”
  log workout page
  my page to input target
  alert to take it easy

Stories:

- As Sarah,
  Given that I opened my app and landed to “this week activity log” page,
  I click “Log Workout”, and input how long I had worked this morning in crossfit gym.

- As Sarah,
  Given that I know my ideal hours of activity per week,
  I click my page and set this week target hours for both workout and running together,
  so that I can be notified by app to take it easy, if I reached my target.

- As Sarah,
  Given that I opened my app,
  I can overview my this weeks activity logs in descended order,
  so that I can image in my head how much I should add running or workout in this week.
